# A-Model-for-Conflicts-Prediction-Using-Deep-Neural-Network
In this study, two Artificial Neural Network  models were developed, the dataset which was extracted  from https://www.data.world uploaded by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). After the development of the models: the baseline  Artificial Neural Network achieved an accuracy of 95 and  a loss of 5 on the training data and an accuracy of 90 and 10 loss on the test set. The Deep Neural Network  Model achieved 98 accuracy and 2 loss on the training  set, with 89 accuracy and 11 loss on the test set.
